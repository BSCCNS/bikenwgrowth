make test run of everything on a testcity
run 04-07 for all parameter sets
fix efficiency calculations for edge cases

X polish plots
X instead of turning streets completely into bike lanes, decrease speed (=increase effective distance) from 50km/h to 5km/h 
X implement directness_lcc, length_lcc
X analysis-plot: add levels for: existing net (biketrack, and bikeable)
X analysis-plot: add overlap with existing net
X measure overlap
X measure relative cost and efficiency (to MST)
X analyze and plot metrics also for car setminus created bike networks
X fix delete_overlaps
X calculate metrics in a smart, additive way, especially coverage
X fix efficiency_local 0
X fix poi_coverage 0
X fix non-positive weight errors that happen in 03,04 for some cities
X fix division by zero in 05, in calculate_directness: return total_distance_haversine / total_distance_network
X pois should be created from data network file, not from online OSMNX. otherwise online changes will make data inconsistent if 01 and 02 are run at different times.
X re-run 03 for poi_source grid
X fix all *_poi_grid_nnidscarall.csv being empty!
X compress data to be commitable (below 100MB)
X loop 06 through cities
X consider edge cases: <2 POIs, <2 clusters, etc
X fix speed issue with buffer
X measure efficiency of existing infrastructure (simplified graphs, subsample)
X calculate coverage along edges, not nodes
X pull constants and parameters
X measure local/global efficiency of abstract GT
X analyze cluster data
X implement additional absolute cluster cutoff
X fix and test grid generation with numpy
X analysis in placeid loop
X make 01 more elegant (dict of Gs, involve all osmnxparameters)
X move plots into 06
X bundle all code together in a for loop over placeids
X delete unnecessary imports
X save cluster data
X create biketrackcarall networks in advance, and test
